Enhancement: Improve recover command

Restic recover used to generate a snapshot that contains all root trees
even those which are already referenced by a snapshot.
It now only processes trees not referenced at all.
Also now `recover` has new options that allow to generate one snapshot
per unreferenced tree and specify which tags should be added to the
newly generated snapshot(s).
